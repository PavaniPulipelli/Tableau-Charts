ðŸ“Š Basic Tableau Dashboard
Overview
This project explores Tableau dashboards, covering key features like data connections, dimensions & measures, parameter controls, filters, and different visualization types.

Tableau Features Explored
1. Connecting Data
Tableau allows data import from Excel, CSV, SQL, Google Sheets, and more.
Drag and drop fields to start exploring data relationships.
2. Dimensions vs. Measures
Dimensions: Categorical data (e.g., Date, Customer Name).
Measures: Numeric data that supports aggregation (e.g., Sales, Profit).
3. Parameter Control
User-driven interactivity to adjust visualizations dynamically.
Example: Select different measures (Sales/Profit) in a single graph.
4. Filters
Dimension Filters: Filter based on categorical data (e.g., Country, Product Type).
Measure Filters: Filter based on numerical ranges (e.g., Profit > 5000).
Context Filters: Improve dashboard performance by filtering data first.
